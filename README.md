Recommending songs for the users aroused attention among researchers, as the technology for personalization has developed. In this paper, we implement a music recommendation system using clustering methods. We first evaluate some clustering algorithms that do not take k (the number of clusters) as an input hyperparameter and then evaluate those that build clusters based on a given number of k clusters. We use three evaluation metrics: Davies-Bouldin Score, Silhouette Score, and CalinskiHarabasz index. We conclude that the Davies-Bouldin Score is the best evaluation
metric for our problem and K-Means is the optimal clustering algorithm. Finally, we present a Music Recommendation System based on the trained optimal algorithm.
